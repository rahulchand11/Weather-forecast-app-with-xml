# Weather-forecast-app-with-xml
Hello there as there was raining in dehradun today. So just for learning and fun purpose I have made this Weather app that will provide you the weather of the current day. In this project I have used XML to fetch data from the Weather API. And Switch case for changing the images according to weather condition. As a beginner I think learning new methods is okay but having a suffiecent amount of knowledge with the previous methods is a good way to enhance and know more about the new methods as it develop the curoisity to learn it.
